However, our (digital) cultural, technology, and design practices are all highly visual. In other words, in many cases, the technology that we interact with does not build upon our capabilities for multi-sensory perception. New developments do make it possible to design technology that is more multi-sensory. There are examples of 3D audio interfaces, haptic feedback, and spacial interactions through AR and VR. However, thinking about, designing, and applying these technologies in a meaningful and responsible ways is not easy. In the course Designing a Multi-Sensory Future we will help you to develop a multi-sensory mindset for technology interaction, and we will provide you with the tools to start designing straight away."
